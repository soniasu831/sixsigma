In this investigation, the team employed bootstrapping simulations to assess the impact of various purchasing strategies on the costs associated with school bus procurement."),
          p("In particular, the team evaluated how the average price per seat changes as the percentage of different bus manufacturers within the school bus fleet changes. For these scenarios, simulated data were created by selectively sampling from the original dataset based on manufacturers of interest. For example, if we were interested in evaluating what the average price per seat for Type D buses would be if 33% of the school bus fleet were made by GreenPower, we would split the dataset into two pools – one made up of Type D bus contracts for GreenPower buses, and one with all of the other Type D bus contracts. We would then examine the total number of Type D buses (21) and sample from the GreenPower pool 7 times with replacement, and sample from the non-GreenPower pool 14 times with replacement. That would give us a single bootstrapped sample. From these single bootstrapped samples, we can calculate the percentage of GreenPower buses and the average price per seat. We can repeat this process many times to find the sampling distribution for average price per seat in this scenario.")
