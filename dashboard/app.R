Districts must make long-term investment decisions without clear pricing standards or predictable cost behavior. Procurement records from 2020 to 2023 show significant differences across states, manufacturers, and dealers. These inconsistencies create equity challenges for districts that rely on stable budgets and transparent pricing. Base prices average about $347,232, so even minor variations represent considerable financial consequences. The problem appears during procurement milestones when districts evaluate bids and select vendors. The variation spans 16 states, 12 manufacturers, and 45 dealers, showing broad national inconsistency. Districts risk overspending when they cannot identify which factors drive cost differences. These uncertainties slow the adoption of clean transportation solutions and weaken planning efforts. This project aims to understand why prices vary and how data can support fairer procurement."),

Improved pricing clarity can speed up adoption and reduce financial barriers for early adopters. Procurement decisions made today will shape fleet composition and cost savings for many years. Ignoring these discrepancies would allow inconsistent pricing to persist across states and vendors. Districts may continue paying uneven prices that strain budgets and reduce access to clean buses. This project supports clean energy goals, equity in public procurement, and waste reduction. Lean Six Sigma tools help identify and reduce unwanted variation in the procurement process.

      p("Electric school buses are technologically mature but still face barriers related to durability, cold-climate performance, and long-term service infrastructure (Lee & Chard, 2023). Although upfront prices remain two to three times higher than those of diesel buses, lower maintenance costs and substantial health and climate benefits can offset this premium over a vehicle’s lifetime (ChargEVC Study Group, 2023; Choma et al., 2024). Adoption remains uneven, with low-income and minority communities disproportionately exposed to diesel pollution and receiving fewer clean transportation benefits (Moses & Brown, 2022). Studies show that purchase cost is the most influential driver of cost-effectiveness for battery-electric buses, making procurement pricing a central barrier to electrification (Avenali et al., 2023). Research also finds that combining distributed energy resources, smart charging, and potential V2G services can reduce operational costs and improve financial outcomes for districts (Becker et al., 2019; Noel & McCormack, 2014; Chen et al., 2023). Successful deployment requires early planning, workforce training, depot space readiness, charger interoperability, and reliable parts availability (Center for Urban Transportation Research, 2023). Best-practice studies highlight the need to match routes with battery range, grid capacity, and community priorities to optimize total cost of ownership (C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, n.d.; Panta et al., 2024). Institutional constraints and outdated procurement norms limit the effectiveness of electric bus contracts, requiring new frameworks that align responsibilities with emerging technologies (Aslund et al., 2025; Kapatsila et al., 2024). Innovative financing models such as battery leasing, bus-as-a-service, joint procurement, and negotiated contracting can reduce upfront prices and stabilize long-term fleet costs (Li et al., 2018; Hensher, 2021; Hensher, 2022). Across case studies, aggregation, standardization, cooperative purchasing, and risk-sharing partnerships consistently lower costs and accelerate adoption while delivering major health and economic benefits (Dolman & Madden, 2018; Smyth et al., 2020; Plotnick & Pierce, 2021; Oester & Woodrum, 2024; Bursey & Kalisa, 2025).")
